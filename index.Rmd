## About Me

I am a researcher at [MDRC](https://www.mdrc.org/about/people/ben-wallace) based in San Francisco and study inequality. 

I graduated with a B.A. at the intersection of sociology, ethnic studies, and history from Duke University. It is titled: *[Constructions of Race and Racial Attitudes in the United States](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17N7oFHydCEBg0QAvFhHnpAuuQwTG5Xh3/view?usp=sharing)*.

Outside of research, I love going to concerts, reading, and exploring the Bay Area's amazing scenery.
