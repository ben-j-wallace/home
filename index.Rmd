## About Me

I am currently a student at Duke University pursuing a self-designed degree titled [Constructions of Race and Racial Attitudes in the United States](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17N7oFHydCEBg0QAvFhHnpAuuQwTG5Xh3/view?usp=sharing).

My research primarily explores the intertwining histories of racial violence and structural racism using computational and archival methods. I am also interested in how racial ideologies are reproduced and reworked across space and time. After Duke, I plan to continue this research through  graduate studies.

Outside of class, I love listening to music, exploring restaurants in Durham, and playing guitar.
