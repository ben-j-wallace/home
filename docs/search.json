If you see anything that interests you or if you want to work together, feel free to contact me at ben [dot] wallace [at] duke.edu.\nWorking Papers\nTeaching Race: White Adolescents and Learning Race in History Curriculum\nIndependent study, supervised by Dr. Sarah Gaither\n\nThis paper begins with a review of racial and ethnic socialization (RES), particularly among white adolescents, and directs it towards a discussion of how pedagogy exists as race-making and socializing practice. Synthesis of psychological, sociological, and educational scholarship reveals thatteachershave a limited effect on white adolescents’ interpretations of history\n\nFor Pride and for Profit: White Elites and Motivations for Urban Segregation\n\nThe history of Chicago’s white elites not only interrupts the popular notion that segregation was limited to the Jim Crow South, but also that segregation in northern cities resulted from New-Deal age practices. By the 1930’s, practices enforcing the National Housing Act like red-lining bolstered pre-existing projects of white self-interest.\n\nRead\nCollective Violence: Mob Formation of Lynchings\n\nAfter reviewing the history of lynching and sociological perspectives of mob formation, I put historical understandings about private and spectacle lynchings to statistical review. Using an ordered logistic model, I demonstrate that Black lynching victims as well as those accused of murder and violations of the interracial sexual color line drew larger mob sizes in the United States, supporting perspectives that tie lynchings to the reinforcement of national white supremacist ideologies.\n\nRead\nData Visualizations in the Age of Mass Incarceration\n\nIn the century since the “American Negro Exhibit,” the practice of data visualization has dramatically evolved in tandem with developments in graphic design, social statistics, and the statistical knowledge state. This paper addresses the prospects, limitations, and implications of using data visualization in representing bodies and discourses surrounding the carceral system. Specifically, I ask how these portraits intervene in representations of those the system entangles, a system which so frequently neglects humanity to those it holds captive.\n\nRead\nMultiple Sovereignties in Bolivia\n\nBy looking at the successes and continuing obstacles for indigenous movements throughout Morales’ administration, we can better understand how indigenous advocates can navigate conflicting versions of sovereignty today in Bolivia’s tumultuous political environment, as well as how other marginalized communities can similarly seek justice in an increasingly globalized and resource-driven world.\n\nRead\nProjects\nArchival Research, Shame of Chicago Documentary\nWatch\nCloseted Podcast\nFive years after the Supreme Court granted marriage equality to same-sex couples, I speak with a closeted student and learn about how internalized homophobia persists in our current era.\nListen\nVisualizing Probability Distributions with ggplot\nCreated using bookdown, an R package, this introductory guide teaches students about probability theory and how to visualize its concepts.\nRead\n\n\n\n",
