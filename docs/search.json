      "contents": "\r\nAt Duke, I have fostered a passion for . I have learned how to parse\r\njail release data and its disparities with peers, contribute archival\r\nresearch for a documentary\r\nseries, advocate with Durham community organizers for community\r\ncare-based alternatives to policing, and produce a podcast exposing\r\nthe factors that keep Duke’s LGBT community closeted.\r\nRegardless of the circumstance, my scholarship has affirmed my own\r\nhumanity and extended it to others. Paralleling this academic journey, I\r\nhave acknowledged my own position within the social scaffold.\r\nConsequently, throughout both my academic and personal, I have reflected\r\non how collective action and transformative justice can heal the wounds\r\nof our past and present.\r\nRead below about some of the papers and projects that I have worked\r\non over the past three years. If you see anything that interests you or\r\nif you want to work together, feel free to contact me at\r\nben [dot] wallace [at] duke.edu.\r\nWorking Papers\r\nFor\r\nPride and for Profit: White Elites and Motivations for Urban\r\nSegregation\r\n\r\nThe history of Chicago’s white elites not only interrupts the popular\r\nnotion that segregation was limited to the Jim Crow South, but also that\r\nsegregation in northern cities resulted from New-Deal age practices. By\r\nthe 1930’s, practices enforcing the National Housing Act like red-lining\r\nbolstered pre-existing projects of white self-interest.\r\n\r\nRead\r\nCollective\r\nViolence: Mob Formation of Lynchings\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the history of lynching and sociological perspectives\r\nof mob formation, I put historical understandings about private and\r\nspectacle lynchings to statistical review. Using an ordered logistic\r\nmodel, I demonstrate that Black lynching victims as well as those\r\naccused of murder and violations of the interracial sexual color line\r\ndrew larger mob sizes in the United States, supporting perspectives that\r\ntie lynchings to the reinforcement of national white supremacist\r\nideologies.\r\n\r\nRead\r\nData\r\nVisualizations in the Age of Mass Incarceration\r\n\r\nIn the century since the “American Negro Exhibit,” the practice of\r\ndata visualization has dramatically evolved in tandem with developments\r\nin graphic design, social statistics, and the statistical knowledge\r\nstate. This paper addresses the prospects, limitations, and implications\r\nof using data visualization in representing bodies and discourses\r\nsurrounding the carceral system. Specifically, I ask how these portraits\r\nintervene in representations of those the system entangles, a system\r\nwhich so frequently neglects humanity to those it holds captive.\r\n\r\nRead\r\nMultiple Sovereignties in\r\nBolivia\r\n\r\nBy looking at the successes and continuing obstacles for indigenous\r\nmovements throughout Morales’ administration, we can better understand\r\nhow indigenous advocates can navigate conflicting versions of\r\nsovereignty today in Bolivia’s tumultuous political environment, as well\r\nas how other marginalized communities can similarly seek justice in an\r\nincreasingly globalized and resource-driven world.\r\n\r\nRead\r\nProjects\r\nCloseted Podcast\r\nFive years after the Supreme Court granted marriage equality to\r\nsame-sex couples, I speak with a closeted student and learn about how\r\ninternalized homophobia persists in our current era.\r\nListen\r\nVisualizing\r\nProbability Distributions with ggplot\r\nCreated using bookdown, an R package, this introductory\r\nguide teaches students about probability theory and how to visualize its\r\nconcepts.\r\nRead\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
