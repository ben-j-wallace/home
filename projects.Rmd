## Working Papers

### Teaching Race: White Adolescents and Learning Race in History Curriculum 

*Independent study, supervised by [Dr. Sarah Gaither](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/sarah.gaither)*

> This paper begins with a review of racial and ethnic socialization (RES), particularly among white adolescents, and directs it towards a discussion of how pedagogy exists as race-making and socializing practice. Synthesis of psychological, sociological, and educational scholarship reveals that teachers have a limited effect on white adolescents’ interpretations of history

### For Pride and for Profit: White Elites and Motivations for Urban Segregation

> The history of Chicago’s white elites not only interrupts the popular notion that segregation was limited to the Jim Crow South, but also that segregation in northern cities resulted from New-Deal age practices. By the 1930’s, practices enforcing the National Housing Act like red-lining bolstered pre-existing projects of white self-interest.

### Collective Violence: Mob Formation of Lynchings

> After reviewing the history of lynching and sociological perspectives of mob formation, I examine how conflict threat perspectives can incorporate more recent theoretical developments. Using an ordered logistic model, I find that Black lynching victims as well as those accused of murder and violations of the interracial sexual color line drew larger mob sizes in the United States, supporting perspectives that tie lynchings to the reinforcement of national white supremacist ideologies.

### Data Visualizations in the Age of Mass Incarceration

> In the century since the “American Negro Exhibit,” the practice of data visualization has dramatically evolved in tandem with developments in graphic design, social statistics, and the statistical knowledge state. This paper addresses the prospects, limitations, and implications of using data visualization in representing bodies and discourses surrounding the carceral system. Specifically, I ask how these portraits intervene in representations of those the system entangles, a system which so frequently neglects humanity to those it holds captive.
