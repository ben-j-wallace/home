At Duke, I have fostered a passion for . I have learned how to parse jail release data and its disparities with peers, contribute archival research for a [documentary series](http://www.shameofchicago.org/), advocate with Durham [community](https://durhamforall.org/) [organizers](https://durhambeyondpolicing.org/) for community care-based alternatives to policing, and produce a [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/benjwallace/closeted) exposing the factors that keep Duke's LGBT community closeted. 

Regardless of the circumstance, my scholarship has affirmed my own humanity and extended it to others. Paralleling this academic journey, I have acknowledged my own position within the social scaffold. Consequently, throughout both my academic and personal journies, I have reflected on how collective action and transformative justice can heal the wounds of our past and present.

Read below about some of the papers and projects that I have worked on over the past three years. If you see anything that interests you or if you want to work together, feel free to contact me at `ben [dot] wallace [at] duke.edu`.

## Working Papers

### For Pride and for Profit: White Elites and Motivations for Urban Segregation

### Collective Violence: Mob Formation of Lynchings

> After reviewing the history of lynching and sociological perspectives of mob formation, I put historical understandings about private and spectacle lynchings to statistical review. Using an ordered logistic model, I demonstrate that Black lynching victims as well as those accused of murder and violations of the interracial sexual color line drew larger mob sizes in the United States, supporting perspectives that tie lynchings to the reinforcement of national white supremacist ideologies.

### Multiple Sovereignties in Bolivia

> By looking at the successes and continuing obstacles for indigenous movements throughout Morales' administration, we can better understand how indigenous advocates can navigate conflicting versions of sovereignty today in Bolivia's tumultuous political environment, as well as how other marginalized communities can similarly seek justice in an increasingly globalized and resource-driven world.
